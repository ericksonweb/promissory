get-own-property-symbols
========================

[![build status](https://travis-ci.com/es-shims/get-own-property-symbols.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.com/es-shims/get-own-property-symbols)

This is a widely compatible, mobile-friendly, and zero dependencies polyfill for `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`.
```js
var getOwnPropertySymbols = require('get-own-property-symbols');

var o = {};
var s = Symbol();

o[s] = 123;

Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o);  // []
getOwnPropertySymbols(o);       // [s]

// same as
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(o);// [s]
```


This module brings in a global `Symbol` initializer too, together with `Symbol.for` and `Symbol.keyFor` methods.
```js
var s = Symbol.for('me');
Symbol.for('me') === s; // true

Symbol.keyFor(s); // 'me'
```

Common symbols like `iterator` are also defined including the `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]`
and the `String.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` method.
```js
// this is the equivalent of a for/of in ES6
var iterator = [1,2,3][Symbol.iterator]();
var result;
while (!(result = iterator.next()).done) {
  console.log(result.value); // 1 then 2 and then 3
}


// this is the equivalent of a for/of in ES6
var iterator = 'ðŸ˜ºðŸ˜²'[Symbol.iterator]();
var result;
while (!(result = iterator.next()).done) {
  console.log(result.value); // 'ðŸ˜º' first and 'ðŸ˜²' after
}

```

It is also possible to simply copy same iterator for any other iterable collection.


### Caveats
There are few things developers need to know about `Symbol` partial polyfills. Here a quick summary.

#### `null` Objects
This polyfill _will not work with `null` objects_, and even if [it's possible to make it work](https://gist.github.com/WebReflection/56d04ccb1e5b0e50c121#comment-1426442) it's not worth the hassle.
```js
var o = Object.create(null); // or {__proto__: null}
var s = Symbol();

o[s] = 123;

// not set as Symbol, just as generic key
Object.keys(o); // [s]
```

#### the `typeof` gotcha
It is not possible to overwrite native `typeof` operator and while it returns `symbol` with native support, since version `0.5.0` it returns `object` when polyfilled.
This is not perfect, but at least it's simple to distinguish between Symbols and regular properties in list of mixed properties collections.

#### cross-realm incompatibility
`Symbol.for` and `Symbol.keyFor` can't be shimmed cross-realm. To be extra fair, `Symbol` should never be used cross-realm unless natively supported.

#### is `Symbol` native ?
Since it's not possible to overwrite `typeof`, a check against `typeof key === "symbol"` is all we need to understand if support is native or not.
Please note that transpilers might wrap this check so we should be sure the test is done natively and not before transpiling.


#### the `in` operator
Since it's also not possible to overwrite `in`, please note that `Symbol() in {}` is always true since SYmbols need to be shimmed through the `Object.prototype`.


#### How to use
Either `npm install get-own-property-symbols` or include [this file](build/get-own-property-symbols.js) on your page.


#### More details
There are alternatives to this polyfill [Symbol only](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-symbol#es6-symbol) and the main difference is that whit `get-own-property-symbols` you actually have `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` functionality and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` will never show Symbols too.

Also today [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) brings Symbols in, but as part of the entire `core-js` partial polyfill, and with same caveats described in here.

Accordingly, if you are looking for a backward compatible, stand-alone version, as ES6 compliant as possible partial polyfill, use this module, otherwise feel free to pick alternatives.

**Please note** this polyfill is also **compatible** with [Object.assign](https://github.com/ljharb/object.assign#objectassign-).


#### Compatibility

##### Mobile

  * Android 2.x and higher ( Android 2 requires code minification if `Symbol.for` is used, or `Symbol['for']` instead )
  * iOS5 and higher
  * Windows Phone 7 (IE9 Mobile) and higher
  * Blackberry OS7 and higher
  * FirefoxOS 1.0 and higher
  * Opera Mini and Opera Mobile
  * Ubuntu Phone, Kindle Fire, and all others based on Webkit or Chrome
  * yes, even Palm WebOS 2 works


##### Desktop

  * IE9 and higher
  * Chrome and Opera
  * Firefox
  * Safari


##### Server

  * node js 0.6 and higher (as tested via travis)
  * io.js has native support, so it works there too
  * Duktape and Nashorn should be fine too (please let me know if not)
