**Promissory** is the Erickson Senior Living (ESL) design system and style guide for creating and maintaining a unified, cohesive online presence. The name "Promissory" is a reflection of the ESL brand tagline [**"We Promise"**](https://youtu.be/PQL77tH8evA), and signifies the "promise" of a consistent front-end user experience supported by standardized web development processes.
